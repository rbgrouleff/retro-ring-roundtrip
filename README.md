# Ring Retro Roundtrip

A small set of examples of how to use ring and friends.

## Usage

To see the first example run 

    lein ring server 
    
You can change the active handler in `project.clj`

## Exciting exercises

This is a retro roundtrip so here are some retro assignments:

- Build a simple page with a greeting and a visitor counter using a Clojure `atom`
- Build a simple guestbook. You can use an external datastore of your choice, or a Clojure `atom`.

That's right! No fancy TODO or Twitter-clone examples here!
